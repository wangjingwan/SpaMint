SPROUT_impute_v2
    1. Gradient <0 =0
SPROUT_impute_v3 2022/11/22
    1. Term1 was equalized by dividing sc_spot_sum by cell number per spot
    2. Term3 was equalized by: 
        1) np.sqrt(aff/2); 
        2) summed expression of pair RL to the mean when calculating rl_agg
SPROUT_impute_v4 2022/11/28
    1. Term3 LRagg calculation
        Given that a gene g1 can be consider as both L and R
        Add the sum of L(g1) and R(g1)
    2. Add regulization term \sum X^2 in gradient descent
    3. Change Learning rate parameter from gamm to ETA
    4. Add hyperparameter DELTA for the newly add regulization term
    5. Change the naming format of the hyperparameters
SPROUT_impute_v5 2022/12/20
    1. Added weight on hvg genes
    2. Updated the calculation of term3 with neighobring-indicator mat, accelerate from 22s to 2s.
    3. Remove parameter p_dist, change to auto scale.
    4. Correct the scale method from same max each cell to same sum each cell.
    5. Added inital adjustment of each term's weight
SPROUT_impute_v6 2023/03/14
    1. Added center shift embedding
    2. Add a new neighbor calculation method to adapt to slide-seq data
    3. Assign coordinates if is slide-seq data 
    4. Adapt to spatalk input
    5. Enable user-specific init embedding
    6. Deleted st_coord parameters, subset from st_adata
SPROUT_impute_v8 2023/06/12
    1. Added reselect cells
    2. Added prep
SPROUT_impute_v9 2023/07/24
    1. Reform input, start from cell selection
    2. Add estimation of cell number per spot function inspired from cytospace
    3. Add repeat penalty for cell selection. If a cell have been selected over the threshold, lower its chosen probability.
SPROUT_impute_v10 2023/12/28
    1. Fix bugs in cell selection processing slide-seq data (no neighbor found issue)
    2. Release memory
SPROUT_impute_v11 2024/02/15
    1. Adapt merfish data (less st gene)
    2. Chage prep adata, if ST gene number is small, align with SC, fill with NA
